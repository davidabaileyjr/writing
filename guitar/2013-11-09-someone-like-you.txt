How To Play 'Someone Like You' On Your Guitar

I was just practicing some scales the other day...and heard a familiar tune pop up. So, I played around with it for a couple of minutes and picked out the chorus for 'Someone Like Me' by Adele. 

It seemed to be pretty easy, so I decided to go ahead and learn the whole thing.  The song ended up being even easier then I thought. So, here are some of the  resources and guitar lessons that I found online. 

## Learn The Song

So, the first thing you'll want to do is learn the song. This usually helps when  learning to play a song on your guitar for some reason. ;)

Once you nailed the basic melody and lyrics for the song...then you're ready to  start learning how to play it on your guitar. 

## Download Chords and Tabs

So, go ahead and download the chords and tabs for the song. Then print them off.  That way you can follow along with the lessons...and practice the song even when  you aren't at the computer.

[Chords In The Key of G with Capo][gchords] | [Alternate Version][altg]

You can also download and print off the tabs for 'Someone Like You' if you want to  play the fingerstyle version as well as strum it.

Here are a few extra goodies as well. These are a couple of other versions that I found as well that can help you improve your skills.

No,  there isn't a bass in Adele's song...but it's still fun to play around with and add  a unique sound to your improvisations.
