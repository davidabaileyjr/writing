I've been learning how to play Three Little Birds by Bob Marley this week. So once again, I've put together the resources that I've found and been using to learn how to play this song on my guitar. Hopefully other beginning guitarists will find it useful as well. 

## Learn How To Play Three Little Birds On Your Guitar

Three Little Birds is really easy to learn and play on your guitar. There are only three chords in the whole song...and you simply repeat the chorus and verse three times.

Even though, I could play this song right after the first lesson...it still took me almost a week to nail this song down.

First, because 95% of my attention this week has been on nailing down some fingerstyle lessons I've been working on over at [GuitarNick][] with a [speed training metronome][]. 

And secondly, I wanted try and transcribe the melody to this song on my own, before looking at the tabs. I totally slaughtered the song, but it was a good exercise in ear training. 

In some ways, I did better than I thought. Even though I was off-key...my intervals in between notes where much better than I expected. 

That's because I had a bad ear infection when I was two years old which left me with a significant loss of hearing. So, I never thought I could be a good musician.   

But recently, I'd been just picking along on my guitar and realized that I could pick out parts of songs I knew. That made me realize that I'd just been using my hearing loss as an excuse for not improving.
