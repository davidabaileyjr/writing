Let's brainstorm some ideas for an ESL mini-novel for our ESL Students. That means that we want a novel that is easy for English students and can be used to create English lessons. That means the vocabulary should be visual and action-based. We want to get other teachers and students involved in it's creation. And we want to snowflake it out into a 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 page novel for different levels. It would be nice to put on Amazon and have it beome an Amazon/NYT best-seller. It would be nice to sell with English lessons for different levels. It would be nice to have others get involved in its creation. It would be nice to have students trade help for getting access to it. It would be nice to create an app for this and sell in iphone/android apps. It would be really cool to create a script and direct a movie for it. And even to create a soundtrack for it. Lots of possibilities. 

1. A man trying to learn English to keep his job
