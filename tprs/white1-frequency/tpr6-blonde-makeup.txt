Blonde is watching T.V. Her phone rings. Brad Pitt asks her to go with him to a friend's birthday party. She is very happy. 

Brad came to her house and knocked on the door. Brad told her that she was beautiful. She looked in the mirror and frowned.

She told him to sit on the couch while she got ready. She went in her bathroom and took a shower. Then she brushed her teeth. 

After that she brushed her hair. And she flossed her teeth. Finally, she  brushed her hair. Two hour later she looked out and saw Brad sleeping on the couch. 

She went back to her bedroom to put on her make-up. She washed her face. Then she put blush on her cheeks. She plucked her eyebrows. Then she put eyeliner around her eyes. 

She put mascara on her eyelashes. But she didn't like it. So, she took off the mascara and put on her fake eyelashes. Finally she put earrings in her ears. 

7 hours later she was ready. She smiled at herself. "I am the most beautiful woman in the world", she thought. 

She walked out into the living room. "I'm ready Brad." But Brad was not on the couch. "Brad? Where are you?", she asked. But Brad was not there. 

Brad was at the party with another woman.
