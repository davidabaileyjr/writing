I started off by watching a [video by Mike Herbert][mike] that really broke this song down into a very easy to play format for a beginning guitarist like me. I learned how to play it pretty quickly.  

But I wanted to learn the melody as well so I could sing it better as well. I searched around on youtube and found some great videos and resources online. 

So, I'm just gonna jot down some of the things I did to learn how to play Stand By Me on my guitar while these ideas are still fresh in my mind.
