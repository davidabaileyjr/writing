Hey pretty woman
Walking down the street 
Hey pretty lady
Walk into my life
Walk into my arms
Let me hold you tight

I've been waiting for you
Make my dreams come true
All I want is you

Let me open up my heart
Let me bare my soul to you
I'll do anything you want
I'll make your dreams come true

But it has to be right now
Cause I'm moving on tonight
If you wait to long
You'll never see the light
