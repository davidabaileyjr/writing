I'm thinking about creating the perfect software system to organize the perfect life. A software program that will allow me to accomplish every goal I set. I think that would be the most amazing software ever. And then, I'd just give it away and watch everyone else create an amazing life. We'd all live amazing lives together. 

I mean, there are so many amazing tools out there to help me get organized and do things that I want. But they are all scattered around. Bits and pieces here and there. 

Usually, they're a part of this huge system...and sometimes I don't want the whole system. Sometimes I just want a part of it. But I go in and get bogged down with the stuff that the system wants me to do. 

It's like logging into Facebook to send someone a message. 30 minutes later, I log off 30 minutes later, only to realize that I forgot to send the message that I logged into Facebook for in the first place.

## Getting Sucked Into The Whirlpool 

And then, there's blogging. I love writing. But I hate editing and doing all the things that blogs want me to do...like tag, categorize, help the search engines find it, add pictures, etc. And by time I finally post it...I'm exhausted and don't want to write another blog post again ever. 

I mean, I can write 750 words in about 25 minutes. But then it takes me several hours to get it up on the blog and presentable for the world. I don't know. Maybe I just overcomplicate things. But why shouldn't I find ways to simplify things. That's what I want my perfect software to do. 

### Simplify

But then I start to realize that it might not be the system. Maybe the real problem is just me. Maybe another program wouldn't work. Maybe my whole operating system is out-dated. Maybe I need to fix me first. 

I mean...it's like playing the guitar. I've spent years trying to learn how to play it. I know lots of chords. I can play a riff of 'Purple Rain'. I can play a lick from 'Sweet Child O Mine'. I know a few strumming patterns. I can fingerpick a couple of different things. But ask me to play a frickin' song. And I might actually be able to play a single song. Maybe. 

And so I ask myself, why do I want all these things?

Why do I want to do so many things? Why do I try to learn so many things? And yet master so few? Play the guitar. Play the drums. Write a novel. Create a blog. Jog 5 kilometers [that one took over a year and 3 tries...and I can kind of run a 5K...but now I have to keep doing it so I don't lose what I've got.] 

### And The List Keeps Growing

Learn to program in Python. [I read one whole book...and half of several other books. I even signed up for several course online. But ask me what I can program today.] I read a 500 page book on HTML about ten years ago. But ask me what I can do with that today. I don't think I've ever actually created a webpage from scratch. Wait, I take that back...I did once. And it looked horrid. So, I found a template and just used that. 

And before I get to creating my software...I have to learn how to program first. Right? I mean...c'mon. That's kind of a given. 

And you know what's worse? My list of things to do just keeps getting longer and longer. I keep adding new things to my to do list everyday. I try it out. Dabble around. Read about it. Try to do something with it. I find out that it's harder to do then the salesletter promised me it would be. And I finally give up. I push it back to the end of my to-do list for a later day, when I can try it out again. 

Then, I either moves something else to the front of my to-do list that has been stewing in the back. Like, "I guess playing the drums is harder than I thought, so let me try playing the guitar again to see if it's gotten any easier than when I gave up three months ago."

## Hamster On A Wheel

The cycle continues. I get excited about playing the guitar again. I want to make sure that this time I do it right. So, I visit 500 gazillion blogs...just to make sure someone hasn't invented an easier way to play the guitar since the last time I checked. A month later, I find out that no one has...but hey! "I learned how to play a new riff." 

And then after actually trying out some amazing advice that gets me all excited on Joe Schmoe's blog. Like his really awesome advice that I need to be consistent and play everyday for at least 5 minutes. And I realize that this guitar playing stuff takes more time and energy from me than I want to invest right now. 

So, I quit and push that item to the back of my to-do list for a few more months. And then go back to trying to learn how to play the drum again to see if it's gotten any easier then before. 

It probably hasn't. But I just want to check and make sure. And hey! You know what? I also think I want to learn how to play the saxophone now. 

Is that insanity? Going in circles? Not able to play any of the musical instruments that I've tried. And now I want to try to learn another one. Maybe the saxophone will be easier than the guitar or the drums?

### Try And Stay Sane...Or Go Insane Once And For All 

Hum! Or maybe not? Maybe I shouldn't add the saxophone to my list? Maybe I should just quit trying to kid msyelf that I'm going to play any musical instrument...ever? 

Maybe I should just confess to myself that I like the way Eric Clapton plays the guitar, but I'm not willing to invest 10,000 hours to play like him. Maybe I should just confess to myself that as much as I like music, I probably won't be a rock star I envision myself to be. 

Or on the other hand. Maybe I should just pick one instrument and stick with it. And not put it down again. Maybe I should quit trying to find the latest, newest, secretest, revolutionariest, best method to play the guitar...

And just sit down and learn to play a frickin' song.

I guess that either way, I just have to make a decision. 

I gotta get off the fence. I gotta take sides. 

Do I want to do what I've always done? Keep teaching or become a rock star. 

### I Wanna Be A Rock Star!

Okay. So, than I've gotta commit to learning a repotaire of songs I can play for my friends. 

I gotta put up with the sore fingers. I gotta learn to stretch those fingers out and learn how to play the crazy F chord without the strings buzzing. 

* I gotta learn how to actually sing a song. 
* I gotta actually learn how to keep rhythm. 
* I gotta figure out how to keep myself motivated. 

Maybe I should just start a blog about this. For myself. And to share what I'm learning with others. Mostly just to keep myself accountable. 

I gotta stop reading about others telling me to create a habit by playing everyday...and just start playing the stupid guitar for at least 5 minutes a day. 

### Making Changes...Or Just More Of The Same

And so, this whole stupid rant about not getting things done. And having to find the perfect blogging system...is really all rooted in my frustration with my guitar playing. 

Maybe, if I master my first few songs on the guitar. Everything else in my life will just flow. Or not. But that's okay. Because at least I'll be able to play a song on my guitar. 

But then again, maybe it's like my jogging. I ran 5K...and then kinda quit. Even though I still jog off and on...I haven't been jogging consistently. And I can feel it. I'm slowing down. I get tired faster. 

What happens when I learn my 20 songs? Do I have to keep playing them for the rest of my life? Do I have to keep programming everyday? Do I have to writing for the rest of my life? 

Of all these things on my list...which ones do I really want to be doing for the rest of my life? To keep practicing them? To really enjoy them?

Maybe, I should just scratch off everything on my to-do list that's frustrating me. Maybe I should stop trying to be so strategic. Maybe I should just let things flow more. 

If I feel like playing a song on the guitar today...I'll play it. And if not, I won't worry about. 

### Asking Why?

Maybe, I should just focus on doing the things I enjoy...instead of frustrating myself with things I think I should do. 

Why do we do the things we do?
Why do we think we need to do the things we do?
Do we do them because we think we need to do them?
Do we do them because we think they will make us money?
Do we do them because we love to do them?
Do do them because we have to do them?
Do we do them because we must?
Do we do things out of a sense of obligation?
Do we do them because they make us happy?
Do we do them out of fear?
Do we do them just for the sake of doing them?

Maybe it's time to rethink Nike's slogan. Just do it? Why? Is it really necessary? Is it really important. Or am I only doing it because someone told me I should?

I mean what would happen if we just stopped doing most of the things we've been doing all our lives? 

Would the world stop turning? 
Would anything bad happen?
Could something good take it's place? 

I mean, think about it. If we really believed in Pareto's principle...the idea that only 20% of our actions produce 80% of our results...then what does that mean? 

### What Would Happen If...?

Could I really quit doing 80% of the things I'm doing...and still keep getting most of the results I'm getting right now? 

That would seem to point to the fact that I'm being pretty inefficient. 

That I could be getting much better results with less effort. 

Or does it?

Maybe it's just built into our system. Maybe we just need to learn to chill out and relax more. 

Because if I stop doing things...and try to replace them with something else. Will I become more efficient? Or will I just be replacing them with more inefficient things? 

Often times, we think we're jumping off the merry-go-round. But in reality we're just jumping right back into another spinning ride on the fast-track to now where. 

Hey! Don't look at me to tell you what to do...

I'm just writing the post here...asking the same questions. That doesn't necessarily mean that I have the answers. The fact that I'm asking them...means that I'm still looking for the answerss. 

But just so I don't leave you hanging...

### Here's Something You Can Do Right Now!

Writing this has kind of helped me sort though the cobwebs in my head. So, here's what I plan on doing right now. 

Look at your to-do list today. Ask yourself, why you're trying to do all of these things? Why are they on your list? Who are you trying to impress? Is it really worth it? Is it really having the desired effect? What else are you giving up by spending time on this?

Then go through and write down all the things in your head. Things that have been rolling around for a long time. The things that you've stuffed back into the dark corners of your mind. Dreams that you've had and are still hanging onto. 

Then ask yourself why they are there. Are you just deluding yourself with the idea that you'll do it really well someday...when you aren't even trying to do it now. 

Or is this something that really is important to you. If it's that important, then start taking action on it today. Start playing the guitar today. 

And then keep doing it everyday until you get where you want to with it. 

### More To Come...Soon!

I have some more thoughts on how to help you take the important things that are just an idea in your head...and making them happen. On making your dreams a reality. 

But we'll do that later. For now...just start getting those thoughts down on paper. Then question your reasons and motives for each one of them. 

I'll sign off and let you get to it. Oh, yeah! And later I'll tell you more about the amazing software I'm planning to create.
