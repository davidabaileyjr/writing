Here I am. Bashing my head again. Frustrated at all the things that I've been telling myself that I want to do. I have a whole list of them...[about 10] or so that I mentioned in a previous post. 

I tried doing all of them everyday for the last 30 days. I did most of them at least once. There were several that I did fairly often. But only a few that I did consistently. 

I guess I've just been kidding myself about the things I thought I wanted to do. Like learn how to draw and become a master photographer. Fun things. But not something I really did.  

I think I'm going to scratch them off my list to focus on the ones I really did do...and actually enjoyed. I guess I was just deluding myself into thinking I wanted to do those things. 

Things that I thought were important. Things that others told me I should be doing. I realize that I don't really want them as much as I thought I did. I mean c'mon. I gave myself the liberty to do them...and I didn't even take myself up on them. 

## Only For A Moment And The Moments Gone... 

I'm not going to sit around and keep thinking about them for another 20 years. I'm going to focus on the things that I really do want. 

Thinking practically...there really is now 'tomorrow'. Only the moement. Now. 

And don't worry. I'm not trying to be philosophical here...or go zen on you. 

But I realize that just thinking about being a master guitar player won't help me play like Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix. But playing a little bit everyday...will get me there faster. 

### Master Anything In Just 5 Minutes A Day [Even If It Takes 100 Years]

So, I'm going to start doing it. Even if it's only for 5 minutes a day. Sure, it may take me a long time...but my theory is that if I keep practicing, my skills should keep improving.

Keep in mind that I'm writing these mostly for myself. I haven't actually done this stuff quite in this way before. And it may not even end up working for me. Although, I will keep you posted on how it goes. 
 
## 14 Ideas For Hitting Your Goals

So, here are my ideas for getting things down to brass tacks and actually getting thigs done...or clearning them off your plate once and for all. 

This is what I'm going to be doing to learn how to play the guitar. For real this time. 

### 1. Take A 30 Day Challenge

Try doing it everyday for 30 days even if for only 5 minutes. Actually sit down and try it out. See if you really like doing this. Do, I really want to play the guitar. Or am I just infatuated with the idea of becoming the next Jimi Hendrix. Something I won't do, if I don't actually sit down and practice everyday like Jimi probably did. 

### 2. Break It Down Into A Measurable Goal

I can't put down 'learn to play the guitar' as my goal. How will I know when I've hit it. I'll be unconciously frustrated knowing I can never hit that goal. Or maybe I will hit, but won't realize it because I don't have a way to track it. So, I need to make it manageable. This could be time invested each day, a specific result achieved, or whatever else you want it to be. Examples could be: 'learn how to play 10 Beatles songs' or 'learn all 40 drum rudiments'. 

### 3. Break That Goal Down Even Smaller

It doesn't matter how small you think it looks...it's still gonna take longer to achieve than you think. This will make it easier to reward yourself for an accomplishement. Example could be: "I will learn how to play the easiest beatles song there is"

### 4. Create A Plan To Make It Happen 

Now that you know what you want...now think about how you are going to make it happen. What are the things you actually need to do everyday to accomplish it. Examples could be things like: 
	* Find out which is the easiest Beatle song
	* Find the chords to it online
	* Learn any of the chords you don't know 
	* Watch youtube videos of others playing this song on your guitar. 
	* Create a playlist of these videos to follow along with
	* Find a teacher or someone who can help you learn the song
	* Learn the first verse and chorus
	* Learn the chord sequence for the first verse and chorus
	* Learn the strumming pattern for the song
	* Learn the rest of the verses to the song
	* Practice playing the song everyday until you can play it without looking at the the chords and lyrics
	* Sing it to three different groups of people
	* Record a video of me singing it to prove that I actually learned it. 

### Choose A Time To Focus On It Everyday

Make sure you have a set time to focus on this goal. This will help to develop consistency and create a positive, healthy habit. Link it to something else you do. For example: I will play the guitar after lunch everyday...or I'll play the guitar everynight after putting my kids to bed.
 
### Find Someone To Hold You Accountable

Have someone hold you accountable - Ask someone to check up on you everyday to see if you are still on track. I suppose it would be easier for you to call them an let them know you did it...or not. 

### Reward Yourself When You Hit Your Goal

Promise yourself that you'll do something really nice for you when you reach what you set out to accomplish. Think 'carrot on the stick' to keep you motivated on days when you don't really feel like doing it. 

### Set Up A 'Punishment'

Set up a 'punishment' if you don't hit your goal. Agree on a punishment with the person holding you accountable if you don't hit it. This could be you having to pay them $5.00 each time you don't do it. Or $100.00 if you give up. Of course you can change the values if needed.

### Track Your Progress

Start tracking your progress - Find a way to track what you are doing and for how long. This could be as simple as using a site like Lift.do or posting your progress on Twitter or Facebook. Better yet, you could even blog about it. Everyday, just add a quick update. That way you can also add links to information, resources and videos that you find useful. 

### Speed Things Up

Try to hit your goal as fast as possible. Speed is of essence. The faster you hit your goal and see the results, the more motivated you will be to continue. I don't mean overdo it...like killing yourself the first day at the gym. We all know that slow and steady wins the race. But if you have can spend more time on hitting your goal...then by all means do it. If you can spend more than 5 minutes practicing the guitar that day...then do it. If you have some downtime...focus on your goal. 

### Experiment Different Ideas

Experiment [and learn to fail fast] - Try lots of different things. If something isn't working...you'll discover it faster and can move onto something that does work. You may try one guitar learning method, and find you hate. Next! Move on till you find a method that works for you to hit your goa. 

### Go Public

If you try to keep your goal a secret...you have no reason not to give up. But if you let others know what you are doing...and knowing that you'll have to explain to them why you quit later can be a good motivaion to continue.
 
### Don't Overplan 
It's easy to get caught up in planning and pre-planning and planning to plan. You can spend lots of time planning and thinking about your goal. It can be good. But just planning isn't enough. The best laid plan won't do anyone any good unless it's actually implemented. 

### Do Some Research

Make sure to balance your actual doing with researching better ways of doing things and getting ideas from others. You may just end up finding an easier way to accomplish your goal. You may be making somehting harder than it actually has to be. So, keep an eye out on how others are doing what you want to do.

Remember, that this is just something I'm trying out for myself. I'm no expert in goal-planning. I don't have a doctrate in any of this stuff. So, take whatever I say with a grain of salt. 

I sure would love to hear what you have to think about any of this. Have you done something similar? Did it work for you? Did it not work for you? Why? And most importantly...what are you doing that is working for you. 

So, post your comments below and let's talk.
