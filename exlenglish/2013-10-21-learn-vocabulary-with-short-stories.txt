# How To Create Short Stories From Movies To Practice Your English

When I was younger, I loved watching movies. Van Damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone were some of my favorite 'heros'. I was always inspired by their amazing victories at the end of a movie...after almost being anihalated by their arch enemy. 

And then, I would run off and find a friend who hadn't seen the movie yet to tell him about it. I would retell the whole thing from beginning to end, making sure not to leave out a single detail. I think I was movies best marketing again. 

I think that sometimes I bored my friends to death. But they were always polite enough to let me get to the end of the story. 

And you can do the same to practice your English. But regardless, of whether they like listening to your or not, it's still an amazing way to practice your English. In essence, you are retelling a story. 

Sure, it's a movie that you watched. But when you retell it in your own words, you are practicing your English communication skills. Just like you do when you retell a mini-story. 

You can watch a movie and then write a summary of it in your own words. You now have your own mini-story written out. You can use the subtitles to double-check parts of the dialogues you use. If there are words that you don't know...then learn them. This will help you improve your vocabulary. Make sure to use it fequently. Make up questions about your story, using those vocabulary words that you are learning. Then retell that story to your friends. 

This is a great exercise for improving your English speaking skills. And it's a great way to talk to other people. Almost everyone likes watching movies. Movies are stories in a visual format. So, if you meet someone, and run out of things to talk about, just ask them if they've ever watched this movie. Whether they have or not is beside the point. If they haven't, you can tell them all about it. And if they already have, you can tell them about your favorite parts anyway...and ask them what they thought about it. And then just carry on a normal convesation with them anyway. 

But what do you do when there is a word you don't know? How do you express yourself, when you don't remember a word. It's right there on the dip of your tongue, but you can't recall it. Does't that just drive you crazy?

For example..."my grandmother is in the hospital with hepatitis."

1. Ask them how to say it. 
2. Write it down to learn later. 
3. Use other words to express yourself. 

The important things is to not get frustrated with what you don't know. Realize that this just an opportunity to learn. Now that you know what you don't know...you can learn it. Increase your vocabulary.  

There lots of things that you can learn from a movie. So, watch movies often. Use them to create your own mini-stories. Then retell them to other people. That way you can practice your English skills and develop your fluency.

# How To Learn English Vocabulary With Short Stories

There are a lot of ways to learn new vocabulary words. And there are a lot of tools to help you. But right now, we are going to talk about ways to learn the new vocabulary word in your short stories. 

*If you don't know why you should use short stories...check this out*

1. Underline the words you don't know [Read and listen to the sentences several times]
2. Write them down in your personalized dictionary - Write the sentence from the story. Come up with at least two more sample sentences for each one on your own - Research others on Vocabulary.com/Google/EnglishCentral - Find synonyms/antonyms to go along with them. Create a graphic organizer for each of the new words you are learning.
3. Make flashcards for them (physical/virtual)..and add them to your review schedule. Review according to SRS schedule. 
4. Create 10 questions and answers using that word in every question and answer. 

Once you learn these words, go talk to someone and try using your new vocabulary. If you can't think of anything to say...just tell them the new story that you are learning...that way you can repeat all the words just the way you heard them.***END OF FILE***Focus: Write Vocabulary Post 1

I intend to write a post for English students on how to learn vocabulary with mini-stories. So, let's jot down some ideas. Haven't we done this already? Guess not. So, here's to learning vocabulary with short-stories.

So, I'm looking for an angle to write an article about learning the vocabulary in a mini-story. I think the goal is to get people to use my mini-stories. But the goal is to help people learn English. To improve their vocabulary. 

So, do mini-stories work? Yes. ** They help develop fluency. 
How do they work? ** The mini-stories put the vocabulary words in context. The best part are the questions and answers which allow students to use the words the are learning in different ways to reinforce the words they are learning. 
Stories of students improving their vocabulary with mini-stories?
* How I started using mini-stories - Junior and Aretuza
* Evandro retelling stories
* Leo crying when retelling his first story
* Lana teaching her parents and impressing bank boys
* Students learning 5 words a day for 30 days
Stories of students improving their vocabulary?
* Use activities from TOEFL course
* Rick feeling like his English wasn't improving
* SP man learning perfect accent with movies/stories
* Using themes from podcasts
* Creatin a list from apps like Vocabulary.com
Benefits of improving their vocabulary?
* Words are like bricks in a construction
* It's how you express yourself

And I don't really have any stories of students learning vocabulary. Why? Because I don't have a way for them to track them. Because I haven't really stressed it's importance. It's not something I've really pushed. Great way would be with EC or Vocabulary.com. Or helping them set goals for learning vocabulary. 

In this article, I really want them to understand how learning vocaublary is important. But it seems like a really huge topic. How can I break it down. So, it's useful, practical, and they enjoy it...but most importantly start applying it. 

Was there a time when I didn't know how to express myself? My grandmother has hepitits in the hospital. I could say my mother's mother is sick in  the liver at that place where sick people go to get better. 

Words that I didn't know how to say were 'roof'. I asked people but nobody understood what I was trying to say. The part on top of the house. I knew tile and I knew ceiling. Just take someone outside and point to the roof. Simple. 

How did I use stories. I would watch movies and then tell my friends what happened in the movie. I rented a video and watched it. I loved it, and wanted to tell everyone what happened in the movie. I summarized the story in my own words. 

What is another word for? Saying 'no'. Using expressions. Expressing yourself more clearly and competently. 

So, what about using penflip or draft for this? It's a good idea. You can write your articles. It's a good idea to actually plan out what you want to write about and present and then start writing it out. You already have a fairly good idea. But it's good to start slow and get feedback. 

Maybe just write about it for 30 days in a Desafio format? It's possible. But that would still be better after you know what you are going to write about and then create it as you go. For now, just get today's post written. Don't think so long-term now. Today's goal is one post. 

Okay. So, it should be on the use of mini-stories? 

Just let it flow. Focus on vocabulary and let he vocabulary flow. If you need some feeback form students...then ask for it. 

I get lots of ideas and then don't know how to bring it all together. Or do I. What's the best way to bring this all togther? 

You aleady have an outline for an article. Finish it. Then come back and plan the rest.  



* Hire new girl and train her to take over Estelito's place by the end of November
* Find a way to have all students do TOEFL at the end of each year. 
* Find a way to add their TOEFL scores to their certificate
* Create a game plan for them to improve their English faster with extra-curricular courses - movies, music, grammar, esp, 
* Create a list of suggested reading books for students to buy and use during each semester + English Central
* Condiitional post for students with some resources.
