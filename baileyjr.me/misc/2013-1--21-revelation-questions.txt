I have a lot of questions. 

Turn out the lights and be still. Don't stress or anguish or fight yourself. Ender flow and let all that is goo inside of you pour forth. It's all there. Everything you need, want, or desire you already have. Just let it out. The answers are there. You know them. What you need is already there. you just need to let it come forth. Call it forth. It's within you. Enter flwo. jump into the river and let the river carry you. No need to fight or struggle. Rest. I promise you rest. Good things await you. You know I love you. I always have and I always will. rest. 

You are trying to enter rest. But you are restisisting it. You have questions that you want answers for. But there aren't really any questions for you to answer now that are more pressing than entering rest. The answers will flow out of rest. That is why you come to journal all tense with a gazilion things to do. But after you enter flow and get clear...there is nothing to do. So, just pause and enter rest now. 

I'm stressing about Saturdsys calsses. 

Good. Let it go. 

My neck hurts. 

Ok. Receive healing. Just let healing enter your necke and head and bring relief. Call forth healing. Declare it and release it. Do you notice the questions racing rhouth your mind already beginning to dissipate?

Yes. Things I really wanted answers to...don't seem to be so important. They sill are. And the answers are there. Just not seperated from you. They are yours. The answers are one with you. 

Where is the pain? Contrinue to receive healing. Let it flow. Along with it..just receive peace. Accpt peace. total peace. pure peace. sweet peace. 

Notice the thought about Wendell and Paulo.Let them go. As wellas the mosquitos around you. And the tiredness. The sleepyness. Let it all go. You don't have to hang onto it. Vestigues of the anger and frustration you feel. The attack on the car and from the car tonight. Let it go. Rest. enter rest. Accept peace. Sweet peace. Breathe it all in. Don't sweat the samll stuff. Readlly there is nothing to sweat. 

Hyes, cast al your cares upon me. I care for you. I care of rht esparrows. They get their daily allotment of food as do all my children. You're thinking about the river and a car falling in the river. Samllville. Olympus. Let it go. Relax. Rest. 

What you are looking for is revelation. You originally wanted to know who wo tet revelations. Your jogging journal. Looking for ideas. Direction, TEst. You want revelation. Without the superstition. The stigmas. The attachments. Th select few. Just the truth.  

Okay. Then call it forth. Accept it. Tell it you want it. Tell the revelation keeper that you want it. Pay atenttion. Begin observing when you get it , how it works, when you receive it. how it comes. There are so many subtel things that narauls pick up that you want to 'learn'. But if you pick it up and are a natural it will be so much easier. 

How do I learn like this? It sounds amazing. So, yes, I ask for revelation. I want revelation. I call forth revelation. I want you revelation. Revelation keeper release revelation. 

Good. Now let go of resistance and receive it. yes. Resistence. You resist thing things you most want. You reisist wealth and health and success and prsoperity because you are afraid. Fear rules and has inroads in your life. Don't worry about getting them out. Simply accept love. Let love and joy and peace flood your life. Like oil, the fear will rise to the top and overflow. 

Where do I get the love and joy and peace from: Within and without. Just ask. Noctice the thoughts aout the movie with the actress doing a water box magic show. Let go. Embrace love and peace.
